            <p>Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or game, often competitive and organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.

            <p> with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner.
             A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 
             Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>
